# In progress Datasets 

## **COURSE DESCRIPTIONS**
* **idea**: take course description, predict enrollement, control for professor, subject/dept, (school, reqs met)
* **progress**:
  * raw XML files stored at [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5DfdyRTPhIudjk5VXRMdDk3aEU](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5DfdyRTPhIudjk5VXRMdDk3aEU)
  * seems like crawling is our most likely bet. 
    * [example crawling script](https://github.com/rpryzant/flipadelphia/blob/master/datasets/course_catalog/Abhijeets_crawling_script.py)
    * [example crawler 2](https://github.com/rpryzant/SubCrawl/blob/master/code_release/corpus_generation/subscene_crawler.py)
    * [examples crawler 3](https://github.com/rpryzant/japanese_corpus/blob/master/crawlers/daddicts/d_addicts_crawler.ipynb)
  * but there's also an official api put out by explorecourses (it might be crappy though?)
    * [example usage](http://git.javadeploy.net/jimsproch/explorecourses-api-example/tree/master)
    * [docs](https://github.com/rpryzant/flipadelphia/tree/master/datasets/course_catalog/explorecourses_api)
  * there's also an XML api
    * To get all current active classes, you can simply call http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=xml-20140630&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=%25
    * Data from past years can be obtained by passing an additional flag such as "&academicYear=20162017"
    * This script converts it into JSON: https://gist.github.com/tummykung/cfa37c3be373a3da073ffb9b2de03d7e
    * reid meeting notes
      * throw away attributes
      * days => categorical
      * keep nulls
      * rm termid (dup of term)
      * course => course_number
      * make a new course_level feature (100, 200 etc)
      * make sure there aren't any within-example newlines
      * replace reqs with number of things the course satisfies
      * rename id ==> courseid, classid ==> sectionid
      * rm enrollStatus
      * change startTime/endTIme to some kind of int
      * look into mapping instructure to some kind of importance
